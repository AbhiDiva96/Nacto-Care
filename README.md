Welcome to Nacto Care! We are on a mission to address the critical shortage of nurses in India while simultaneously revolutionizing the way healthcare services are delivered. With a focus on empowering nurses and enhancing healthcare accessibility, Nacto Care strives to make a meaningful impact in the world's largest democracy.

# Problem Statement

India currently faces a significant shortage of nurses, with only 2.06 nurses per 1000 people, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2023 due to migration because of lack of opportunities. This shortage not only puts strain on the healthcare system but also limits access to essential medical services, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly.

# Solution 

- We believe in providing better opportunities and support for Indian nurses, enabling them to thrive in their profession. By offering work opportunity, competitive benefits, training programs, and career advancement opportunities, we aim to attract and retain talented nursing professionals.
- Nacto Care facilitates immediate access to home nursing services for individuals in need, particularly the elderly. By leveraging technology, we connect patients with qualified nurses, ensuring timely and personalized care in the comfort of their homes.
- Similar to how platforms like Zomato and Swiggy have transformed the gig economy, Nacto Care seeks to raise awareness about nursing as a rewarding career choice. Through outreach programs and educational initiatives, we aim to inspire more individuals to pursue nursing as a profession.
- We prioritize the well-being and satisfaction of our patients by offering additional benefits such as a life insurance scheme. This incentivizes patients to choose Nacto Care for their healthcare needs, fostering trust and loyalty in our services.
